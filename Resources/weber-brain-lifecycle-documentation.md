# Weber Brain Application: Comprehensive Lifecycle Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Weber Brain Application's lifecycle, from initial user interaction to ongoing error analysis and improvement. It covers the app installation process, device registration, normal operation, error handling, and backend analysis.

## 2. Initial App Discovery and Installation

### 2.1 NFC Interaction
- User taps their phone to the Weber Brain Device.
- Device sends an NFC payload containing the App Store URL.
- Mobile OS receives the payload and opens the App Store page.

### 2.2 App Installation
- If the app is not installed, the user is prompted to install it from the App Store.
- If already installed, the OS directly opens the Weber Brain App.

## 3. User Authentication

### 3.1 Sign-Up / Sign-In Process
- App displays a welcome screen with sign-up/sign-in options.
- User enters credentials or signs up for a new account.
- App sends authentication request to the Auth Service.

### 3.2 Authentication Error Handling
- If authentication is successful, user credentials are stored locally.
- If authentication fails:
  - Auth Service returns an error to the app.
  - ErrorHandler logs the authentication error.
  - App displays a user-friendly error message.

## 4. Device Registration

### 4.1 Initiating Registration
- App prompts user to register their Weber Brain Device.
- User initiates the registration process.

### 4.2 NFC Scanning
- App activates the NFC scanner.
- If NFC activation fails:
  - ErrorHandler logs the NFC activation error.
  - App suggests manual entry as an alternative.

### 4.3 Device Data Reception
- User taps the Weber Brain Device again.
- Device sends registration data via NFC.
- App receives the device data.

### 4.4 Serial Number Verification
- App sends the serial number to the Backend API for verification.
- API checks the serial number in the database.

### 4.5 Serial Verification Error Handling
- If the serial number is invalid:
  - API reports the invalid serial number.
  - ErrorHandler logs the invalid serial attempt.
  - App displays an error message and prompts user to contact support or retry.

## 5. Device Pairing

### 5.1 BLE Pairing Process
- If serial number is valid, app initiates BLE pairing.
- App attempts to establish a secure connection with the device.

### 5.2 Pairing Error Handling
- If BLE pairing fails:
  - ErrorHandler logs the BLE pairing error.
  - App displays a pairing error message and offers troubleshooting steps.

### 5.3 Successful Pairing
- Upon successful pairing, app requests additional device info.
- Device sends full information to the app.
- App stores complete device info locally.

## 6. UI Activation

- Based on the device model (226 or 678), app activates the appropriate UI.
- App displays a model-specific tutorial to the user.

## 7. Normal App Operation

- User interacts with the app for regular usage.

## 8. Error Handling During Operation

### 8.1 Error Detection
- When an error occurs during normal operation, it's sent to the ErrorHandler.

### 8.2 Data Anonymization
- ErrorHandler uses the Anonymizer to anonymize sensitive data in the error log.

### 8.3 Local Storage
- Anonymized error log is stored in Local Storage.

### 8.4 Background Upload Scheduling
- ErrorHandler schedules a background upload task via WorkManager.

## 9. Log Upload and Analysis

### 9.1 Background Upload
- When conditions are met (e.g., device charging, on Wi-Fi), WorkManager uploads logs to CloudWatch.

### 9.2 Log Processing
- CloudWatch processes and stores the uploaded logs.

### 9.3 Periodic Analysis
- CloudWatch triggers a Lambda function for log analysis.
- Lambda queries CloudWatch for log data.
- Lambda performs initial analysis and updates CloudWatch metrics and alarms.

### 9.4 Machine Learning Analysis
- Lambda triggers a SageMaker model for anomaly detection.
- SageMaker fetches historical data from CloudWatch.
- SageMaker performs anomaly detection and returns results to Lambda.
- Lambda updates anomaly metrics in CloudWatch.

## 10. Feedback and Alerts

### 10.1 Critical Issue Detection
- If a critical issue is detected during analysis:
  - CloudWatch sends a push notification to the app (if configured).
  - App displays a critical error alert to the user.

## 11. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

- The entire process continues to run in a loop, constantly monitoring for errors and improving the system.
- Insights gained from error analysis are used to enhance the app and device functionality.

## 12. Key Considerations

- Privacy: Sensitive data is anonymized before storage and analysis.
- Efficiency: Background uploading prevents impact on app performance.
- Proactive Monitoring: Anomaly detection helps identify issues before they become widespread.
- User Communication: Critical issues are communicated back to users when necessary.
- Scalability: The architecture is designed to handle a growing number of devices and users.

## 13. Conclusion

This lifecycle encompasses the entire user journey from first interaction with the Weber Brain Device to ongoing use and improvement of the app. By implementing comprehensive error handling and leveraging cloud-based analysis, the system ensures a smooth user experience while continuously improving its performance and reliability.
