# Weber Brain UI/UX Development Guidelines

## 1. Design System
- [ ] Establish a consistent color scheme
  - Primary colors:
  - Secondary colors:
  - Accent colors:
- [ ] Define typography
  - Heading font:
  - Body font:
  - Font sizes:
- [ ] Create component styles
  - Buttons:
  - Input fields:
  - Cards:
  - [Add other components as needed]

## 2. Wireframes
- [ ] Create low-fidelity layouts for each screen
- [ ] Define user flow between screens
- [ ] Tools to use: [e.g., Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD]

## 3. Mockups
- [ ] Develop high-fidelity designs based on wireframes
- [ ] Apply design system (colors, typography, components)
- [ ] Pay attention to:
  - Spacing
  - Alignment
  - Visual hierarchy

## 4. Assets
- [ ] Prepare app icons (iOS and Android, all required sizes)
- [ ] Create/source other graphical elements
  - [ ] Vector graphics (SVG) where possible
  - [ ] Raster images in @1x, @2x, and @3x resolutions
- [ ] Use appropriate file formats (PNG for transparency, JPEG for photos)

## 5. Responsive Design
- [ ] Design for various screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Create adaptive layouts (phone vs. tablet)
- [ ] Use Flutter's responsive widgets (e.g., Flex, Expanded, MediaQuery)

## 6. Platform Guidelines
- [ ] Follow Material Design for Android
- [ ] Adhere to Human Interface Guidelines for iOS
- [ ] Create platform-specific UI variations where necessary

## 7. Prototyping
- [ ] Build interactive prototypes
- [ ] Include animations and transitions
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate on designs

## 8. Flutter Implementation Notes
- [ ] Use Flutter's built-in widgets where possible
- [ ] Create custom widgets for unique design elements
- [ ] Implement custom paintings for complex graphics/animations
- [ ] Use appropriate packages (e.g., flutter_svg for vector graphics)
- [ ] Implement a consistent theme across the app

## Additional Notes
- [Add any project-specific requirements or guidelines]
